# naoMatchTracker
simple java program to keep track of how long you've spent playing online matches in a game

## Requirements
- Java 16

## How to run
Open a new command prompt in the folder where the .jar is. type in ``java -jar nameofmatchtrackerfile.jar && exit``. It'll now open. (No, it won't work in powershell.) If you're too lazy to do that each time: I'll provide an executable script that does this for you.
